# Flat Lang

- no nesting
- only number operations at first
- only compute using a fold (finite ops)
- last column represents output (only one output allowed)
    - first columns are inputs
- function composition: visually chain tables together somehow
- use fat ops throughout
    - visualise somehow.. convert errors to eithers..
- for now donâ€™t include product types or lists
    - try to avoid nesting as long as possible..



- all num operations use fat ops
- for bools, just keep bools (everything is total)
- lists are just columns with multiple rows
    - avoid lists of lists for now (maybe forever)
- Tuples?
- Maps?
actually using combinations
